 Automatic number plate recognition is a mass surveillance method that uses optical character
recognition on images to read the number plates on vehicles. Existing closed-circuit television or road-rule
enforcement cameras, or specifically designed systems can be used for the task. This system is very helpful for
traffic police to find the details of a car violating the traffic rules. Its applications also includes Automatic toll
collection system and car parking systems.[1] In high security areas where parking space is reserved for VIP
vehicle owners only, the parking gate will be opened after number recognition. In areas where parking space is
allotted to a particular vehicle, wrong vehicle parked can be recognized. ANPR can be used to store the images
captured by the cameras and the text from the number plate. Systems use infrared lighting to allow the camera
to take the picture at any time of day. A powerful flash can also included in cameras, to both illuminate the
picture and make the offender aware of his mistake. Due to plate variation from place to place ANPR
technology tends to be region specific
